### salt that is stale (not frozen)


The idea of frozen python programs is something that intereststs me. It might be cool to freeze salt into an executable. I am not exactly sure how a frozen salt instance could remain flexible and extensible like the salt being shipped today. There may me some middle gound though. I aim to make this repo contain a POC around some ideas I have in this area.
